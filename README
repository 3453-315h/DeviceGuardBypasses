Windows 10 Device Guard Bypasses
(c) 2017 James Forshaw

This solution contains some of my UMCI/Device Guard bypasses. They're
are designed to allow you to analyze a system, such as Windows 10 S
which comes pre-configured with a restrictive UMCI policy.

CreateAddInIpcData:

Tested on Windows 10 15063.483 with .NET 4.7.

This is an issue with the exposed .NET Remoting IPC channel in AddInProcess.exe
(and AddInProcess32.exe) on .NET v4+. 

See my blog post (https://tyranidslair.blogspot.com/2017/07/dg-on-windows-10-s-executing-arbitrary.html)
for more information about how to use this bypass code.
